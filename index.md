## About Me

Hello and welcome! I am *Wencheng Han*, currently a Ph.D. student at the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (University of Macau), under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Jianbing Shen.

My academic journey began at Shandong University, where I pursued my bachelor's degree from 2012 to 2016. After that, I furthered my studies at the Beijing Institute of Technology, earning my master's degree from 2019 to 2022. In 2022, I commenced my Ph.D. studies at the University of Macau and have been engrossed in my research ever since.

Professionally, between my bachelor's and master studies, I had the privilege to work with Sina Weibo, where I served as a Recommendation System Development Engineer from 2016 to 2019. This experience provided me with invaluable insights and honed my skills in the field.

In my current academic pursuits, I am particularly enthralled by perception tasks for autonomous driving. This includes intriguing areas like Monocular Depth Estimation, Monocular 3D Object Detection, and Visual Tracking. My curiosity doesn't stop there. I am also venturing into the fascinating world of AI for Medical applications, diligently working on projects that intersect technology and healthcare.

Thank you for stopping by. I am always open to collaboration, discussions, or simply a chat about the latest advancements in the field. Feel free to reach out!
